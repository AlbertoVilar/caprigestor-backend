# Conventional Commits template
#
# Use the format:
#   <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# Types:
#   feat, fix, refactor, perf, test, docs, chore, build, ci, style, revert
#
# Common scopes for this repo:
#   events, farm, goats, enums, mapper, db, api, auth, phone, address
#
# Subject rules:
# - Imperative, present tense (e.g., "add", "fix", "update")
# - Lower-case, no trailing period
# - Keep concise; aim for ≤ 72 characters
#
# Body (optional):
# - Explain what and why, not how
# - Wrap at 72 characters per line
# - Include context, decisions, and impacts
#
# Footer (optional):
# - BREAKING CHANGE: <description>
# - Closes #<issue>, Refs #<issue>
#
# Examples:
#   feat(events): add filter by event type and date range
#   fix(events): handle ISO date parsing to avoid 500 errors
#   refactor(mapper): streamline GoatFarm mapper and VO structure
#   chore(repo): add commit template and update documentation
#   docs(api): document event filtering endpoint with examples
#   test(events): add tests for repository date range filtering
#
# If multiple scopes apply, prefer the most specific.
# For cross-cutting changes, use a broader scope like `repo`.
